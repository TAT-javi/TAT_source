fliusb driver installation
--------------------------

Note that this needs to be done each time a new kernel is installed, which
may be often in a distribution like Fedora. From inside the pyfli git
repository the steps are

make clean
make
sudo cp fliusb.ko /lib/modules/$(uname -r)/extra
sudo depmod

Once this is done the driver will be automatically loaded when a FLI usb
device is plugged in. The module directory location used above works for my
distribution, Fedora 17, it may need to be modified for other
distributions. Note, Ubuntu uses 'misc' instead of 'extra'.

udev configuration
------------------

The default permissions of the /dev/fliusb[0-9]* device node created when a
FLI device is plugged in only allow root access. This may be changed and
the device name customized by adding a rules script to /etc/udev/rules.d.
An example script 10-local.rules.example can serve as a template for this,
strip the '.example' extension, modify as needed, and do the copy. The
results can be checked by plugging in a FLI device and looking at the
permissions of the created /dev node. After installing the file it may be
necessary to reload the rules.

sudo udevadm control --reload-rules
